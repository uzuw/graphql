📘 Learn GraphQL: Beginner-Friendly Guide

🧠 What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data. It was developed by Facebook and released in 2015.

Instead of multiple endpoints like REST, GraphQL has a single endpoint that accepts queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

🔄 GraphQL vs REST

Feature

REST

GraphQL

Endpoint

Multiple per resource

Single endpoint

Data Fetching

Over-fetching/Under-fetching

Precise fetching

Versioning

Uses URL versioning

No versioning needed

Responses

Fixed structure

Flexible, client-defined

✅ Why Use GraphQL?

Fetch only the data you need

Reduce network requests

Great for modern UIs (like React apps)

Strongly typed schema

🛣️ Learning Path

1. Understand GraphQL Fundamentals

Queries

Mutations

Subscriptions

Schema & Type System

Resolvers

📘 Resource: https://graphql.org/learn

2. Set Up a Simple Server

Use Apollo Server or Express + express-graphql

Define a schema and resolver

npm install apollo-server graphql

// Simple Apollo Server example
const { ApolloServer, gql } = require('apollo-server');

const typeDefs = gql`
  type Query {
    hello: String
  }
`;

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => 'Hello world!',
  },
};

const server = new ApolloServer({ typeDefs, resolvers });
server.listen().then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`🚀  Server ready at ${url}`);
});

3. Use GraphQL on Frontend

Apollo Client with React

Fetch queries and manage state

npm install @apollo/client graphql

4. Practice Projects

Build a blog API

Fetch GitHub data using GitHub GraphQL API

Create a movie database with GraphQL + React

5. Advanced Topics (Optional)

Authentication in GraphQL

Pagination

Subscriptions (real-time data)

GraphQL with TypeScript

💡 Tips

Think in terms of types and relationships

Use tools like GraphQL Playground or Apollo Studio

Use mock data when experimenting
